Focus: Works the back alleys - pdf-p62


The thief, the burglar, the pickpocket: these are the dangerous individuals who haunt the back alleys of every community. You are a thief in a city or town, making your livelihood at the expense of the wealthy. Your talents, however, prepare you for all kinds of pursuits, even when you’re not crouching in an alley or climbing into a window.


Usually, you dress to blend in with the crowd. When you’re on a mission, black, form-fitting clothing allows you to swim in the shadows.


Most thieves are jacks, but nanos make interesting burglars as well. A glaive thief likely adds a little more physicality to his crimes.


Connection: Pick one other PC. The character knew you beforehand and convinced you to leave your life of crime for other pursuits—at least temporarily.

Background: Forbidden Knowledge


You understand the numenera far better than most people. You know that it isn’t just strange machines buried in old ruins. The numenera is everywhere, beyond the perception of humans. You know that microscopic machines called nanites are threaded through every inch of the world, waiting to be activated. You know that satellites in orbit are broadcasting information, waiting for someone to access it. Having studied long and hard, learning the proper ways to tap into the forces all around you, you know how to activate these machines and make them do what you wish, at least in limited, specific ways. These uses of power are called esoteries.


Through various tiny devices that you possess, which probably seem like magic charms to the uninitiated, you “conjure” energy. By accessing the datasphere transmitted across the world, you connect with machines—including the nanites—to change your environment.


First-tier abilities:
* Esoteries: 2
* Effort: Your Effort is 1
* Genius: 
   * Intellect Edge of 1
   * Might Edge of 0
   * Speed Edge of 0


Expert Cypher Use: 
* You can bear three cyphers at a time. 
* Practiced With Light Weapons: You can use light weapons without penalty. If you wield a medium weapon, increase the difficulty of the attack by one step. If you wield a heavy weapon, increase it by two steps.


Cyphers - single use
* Desiccating detination - p284 - wristband projector, long range. Effect: burnes in the radius of that range, drains moisture in that range, water immediately vaporized: damage equal to the level of the cypher - level is determined by 1d6+2
* Xray Viewer - p297 - glass panel, see through 2ft of material, cyphers level must be higher than the materials level, 1min 1d6+4
* Mind disrupting poison - p292 - ring with a needle, touch, intellect damage equal to the cyphers level, can not take actions equal to the cyphers level - 1d6+2


Numenera Training: 
You are trained in the numenera and can attempt to understand and identify its properties.


Starting Equipment: 
* You start with clothing
* One weapon - Blowgun + 15 darts
* A book about the numenera: Provides an asset to any roll made concerning the subject of the book as long as the character has the book in his possession, can read it, and can devote half an hour to the task (or twice as long as normal, whichever is greater).
* Three cyphers (chosen for you by the GM) - single use
* One oddity (chosen for you by the GM) 
   * 6 small clear plastic bags that can be sealed and are very durable.
* 4 shins (coins)
* Before selecting your weapons, armor, and other gear, you might want to wait until after you’ve chosen your esoteries, descriptor, and focus.


Esoteries: 
You can tap into the numenera to reshape the world around you. Similar in appearance to the way a fabled wizard might seem to cast spells, these expressions of your knowledge are called esoteries. People who are not nanos sometimes call them spells or charms.


Most esoteries must be activated, which requires that you have a free hand and spend 1 or more Intellect points. If no Intellect point cost is given for an esotery, it functions continuously without needing to be activated. Some esoteries specify a duration, but you can always end one of your own esoteries anytime you wish.
